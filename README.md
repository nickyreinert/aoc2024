# Advent Of Code 2024 

This year, I am trying something new because the focus of this game is more on finding the algorithm rather than working on syntax. My goal is to try out a new language every day. I plan to run each language in separate Docker containers to avoid bloating my system, and I will highlight interesting facts about each language — you can find my findings [on my personal blog](https://nickyreinert.de/categories/aoc2024). Let's see how far I get. In three days, I’ll probably fall into another rabbit hole — fingers crossed.
